I did test of the html structure
Passed 11 out 16, need to fix 5 errors
Number of errors that need to be fixed 4, 10, 13, #layout 1, 2
Also need to clarify in what situations we need to use code element <code> </code> in html? Why we need them?
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) I revised the index.html file. Had a problem with tags, I added too many tags got confused and it led to a problem with formatting.
Fixed a problem, spent a lot of time to understand why html file stopped formatting
Also several things related to HTML file, I learnt new tags such as <code> and <article>. While studying at FCC didn't encounter in
the theoretical part.
2) Then I didn't create a new technical documentation, just copied all the information because there were too much text to be copied.
3) Revised css file and codes, need to study againg media queries, I know the theory need to learn how to apply it in reality. When user
visits website via different devices. Also need to study and apply more positioning.
Finally all the test are done. I passed every stage. Need to do more website on plain html and css to be able to apply knowledge I 
already know and to grasp new one.
There is one website left, which I need to finish before I get my first ever certificate in IT)
